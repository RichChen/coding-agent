"""Missing grader ids caused by the candidate's own edit (e.g. an IndentationError it introduced).

Rule: take the grader receipt's runner_error and the tail of each collection-error traceback. If the innermost
frame that belongs to the project is in a file the candidate changed, the run is an ordinary
failure. Otherwise the same image is graded once more with an empty delta (missing_regrade); if that has no
missing id and matches calibration, the run is an ordinary failure too ("execution"). A run whose test
execution timed out and left a grader reason gets the same empty-delta regrade; a consistent one makes it an
ordinary failure ("execution_timeout"). Anything else stays a stop condition.
